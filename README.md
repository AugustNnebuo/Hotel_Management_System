# Hotel Management System

 The Hotel Management System is an intuitive database design project designed to optimize the day-to-day operations of a hotel. It handles guest information, tracks room bookings, and manages reservations seamlessly. By organizing essential data such as guest details, room availability, and stay durations, the system ensures that hotel operations run smoothly and efficiently, providing guests with a high-quality experience.

The primary objective of this project is to  streamline hotel operations by efficiently handling guest information and room bookings. It enhances the guest experience through accurate records and availability, ensuring smooth hotel operations. Additionally, the system supports decision-making by providing valuable insights through data queries, which help in making informed business choices.

The project includes a series of SQL queries and stored procedures designed to meet the specific data analysis and reporting needs of the hotel management department. The database streamlines operations related to guest information, room bookings, and hotel management activities. Below are some of the key functionalities:

## Summary of Queries:

Guest Stay Duration Analysis:

Identifies guests with the same length of stay, allowing the hotel to analyze booking patterns and customer behavior. This is useful for marketing efforts, as it can reveal trends in preferred stay durations among different customer segments.

Room Pricing Insights:

Fetches the maximum room price per room type, providing insights into pricing strategy and helping the hotel optimize room rates based on occupancy and demand.

Guest Distribution by Room Type:

Provides a count of guests per room type, sorted by the number of guests staying in each room category (single, double, suite, deluxe). This helps in resource planning and identifying popular room categories, enabling better room allocation and pricing adjustments.

Guest Information Formatting:

Extracts and formats guest names and stay durations for simplified reporting. This is useful in generating customer insights for loyalty programs, personalized promotions, and internal communications.

Odd-Day Stay Analysis:

Fetches guests who stayed an odd number of days, offering insights into customer preferences and helping the hotel understand how often guests book for shorter or longer stays.

High-Spending Guest Reporting:

Develops a stored procedure to fetch details of high-spending guests based on total booking amounts. This is critical for identifying VIP customers, offering them special promotions, and enhancing customer satisfaction.

Room Booking Data Retrieval:

Creates a view that fetches all booking details where the total amount exceeds a specified threshold, providing insights into high-value bookings and helping the hotel focus on key revenue drivers.

Automated Booking Adjustments:

A stored procedure automates adjustments to room availability and pricing for specific room types when occupancy is above a certain threshold. This reduces manual effort and ensures optimal room utilization.

Comprehensive Guest Reporting:

A complex stored procedure fetches and organizes guest data, including their room type, stay duration, and state of origin, providing a holistic view of the hotel's customer base. The inclusion of error handling ensures that the data retrieval process is robust and reliable.

## Impact on Business Processes:

Data-Driven Decision Making:
By offering detailed insights into guest stay patterns, room pricing, and booking behavior, the hotel can make informed decisions about room allocation, pricing strategies, and marketing campaigns.

Operational Efficiency:
The automated processes for booking adjustments and reporting reduce the manual workload of hotel staff, allowing them to focus on customer service rather than administrative tasks.

Revenue Optimization:
Insights from high-spending guest reports and room pricing trends enable the hotel to identify key revenue sources, optimize room pricing, and target high-value customers for loyalty programs and promotions.

Resource Management:
The ability to analyze guest distribution by room type helps the hotel manage room availability, optimize occupancy rates, and ensure a smooth operational workflow in room service and housekeeping.

Strategic Planning:
The reporting capabilities allow the hotel to strategically plan for peak seasons, adjust pricing and promotions, and better understand customer preferences to enhance guest satisfaction and increase repeat business.

Error Mitigation:
The inclusion of error handling in stored procedures ensures the integrity and accuracy of data, minimizing the risk of errors in key business processes such as guest booking and financial reporting.
